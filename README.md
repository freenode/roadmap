# freenode roadmap

Welcome to freenode's roadmap repository, where we describe and track planned changes and improvements to the free and open source software that we use to run our network, so that you can get an idea of what we're up to or find things to get involved with.

We use a variety of free software, both in-house and upstream, to meet the needs of our communities. Noteworthy examples include:

* the [irc server](https://github.com/solanum-ircd/solanum) we're moving to
* the [services package](https://github.com/atheme/atheme) we use
* our [website](https://github.com/freenode/web-7.0).

A full list of the software we maintain ourselves can be found at our [GitHub profile](https://github.com/freenode).

If you have questions, suggestions, or would like to [contribute](https://freenode.net/contributing), feel free to ask us questions in `#freenode-dev` on freenode (instead of in issues on this repository) and we'll answer as best we can.
